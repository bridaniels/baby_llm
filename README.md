## **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
-  machine translation of human language via machine learning algorithms 
- trained to perform specific tasks

## **Language Modeling (LM)**
- statistical and probabalistic techniques to determine probability of word sequencing
- probability distribution over a sequence of words 

## **Large Language Models(LLMs)**
- large scale neural network language models resulting in a next word prediction engine
- deep learning models, typically general purpose
- typically trained on simple tasks (next word prediction)
- culmination of training on vast sets of data increases the parameter count and enables fine-tuning of skills.
