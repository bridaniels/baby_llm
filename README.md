# Large Language Model (LLM)

---
Using `langchain` and OpenAI
- ([langchain source](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain))
- ([OpenAI Account Generation](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys))

---
## **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
-  machine translation of human language via machine learning algorithms 
- trained to perform specific tasks

## **Language Modeling (LM)**
- statistical and probabalistic techniques to determine probability of word sequencing
- probability distribution over a sequence of words 

## **Large Language Models(LLMs)**
- large scale neural network language models resulting in a next word prediction engine
- deep learning models, typically general purpose
- typically trained on simple tasks (next word prediction)
- culmination of training on vast sets of data increases the parameter count and enables fine-tuning of skills.

## **Machine Learning Architecture**
- why don't these individual formats work for LLMs
### Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- vanishing gradient problem
- gradient-based learning methods with backpropagation 
### Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
- 
### Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM)
- 
### Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)
- 
### Self-Supervised Learning 
- 
### N-Gram
-
